	<h3>Career Goals</h3>
	<p>
		My goal is to evolve as a full-stack developer, specializing in high-performance web
		applications and scalable backend systems. I am constantly exploring new tools and technologies,
		with a current focus on mastering JavaScript frameworks.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am also passionate about game development, and one of my long-term goals is to create a fully
		open-source game engine specifically designed for my upcoming game, <strong>Voxploria</strong>.
		While <strong>Voxploria</strong> itself will be a closed-source project, my vision for the game engine
		is to make it freely accessible with no paywalls, empowering other developers and creators to build
		their own projects without financial barriers.
